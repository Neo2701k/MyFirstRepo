# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi, I'm Neo. I'm currently learning programming languages and enrolled in a pathway course. Iâ€™m passionate about becoming a software engineer. I enjoy learning new technologies and collaborating on meaningful projects.

I'm eager to develop games using Unity or Unreal Engine and build apps that can have a social impact.
